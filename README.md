## About The Project
COVID cases are rising a second time in the states, so individuals need a way to assess their COVID exposure risk based on their day to day activities. This application allows users to keep track of their daily activities by answering a questionnaire that assesses their risk level of contracting COVID based on a score that is dependent on their location and marked activities, providing them with testing sites nearby if their risk score is high.
